        value="E-1 arrived on scene at 14:06 to find a two-and-a-half story wood-frame single-family dwelling with light smoke showing from the kitchen window on Side A. Captain Davis established command. E-1 crew forced entry through the front door and advanced a 1.75-inch attack line to the kitchen, where they found a small fire on the stovetop extending to the adjacent cabinets. The fire was quickly knocked down. L-1 arrived and performed a primary search of the first and second floors, which was negative. L-1 crew then performed vertical ventilation over the kitchen area. One civilian occupant, John Smith, had evacuated prior to arrival and was assessed by EMS for minor smoke inhalation before being transported to Anytown General Hospital. The fire was determined to be accidental, caused by unattended cooking. Overhaul was completed, and the scene was turned over to the homeowner. All units cleared at 15:30."
